	<h2>Reflection</h2>
	<p>TThis portfolio has taught me many things about fragrances. Even though I missed a few lessons because of this assignment, I hope I have gained a bit more knowledge on fragrances. This assignment has been extremely tough for me. I didn't want to do a normal portfolio and print it out on Microsoft Word, So I decided to code a whole website. I wanted to give something different; I hope the website will be to your liking.
The fragrance has taught me that scent has been a very important role in attracting the opposite sex. From the market research, I have done, most of the scent videos are man spraying cologne, and a lady will appear.
This has also taught me how to produce essential oil's in the comfort of my home, and it wouldn't be too expensive if I ever decide to create any.
The next thing I did not notice is that the mind and the nose work together incredibly well. Smelling something very familiar will lead to a memory. Depending on the memory it can cause you to dislike or like the scent. For example, Lavender "sleep" pillow mist, Every night before I go to bed I will spray the mist on my pillow to help me sleep.
I would also like to thank you for giving me a chance</p>
