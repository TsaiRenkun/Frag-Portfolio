	<p>
How was it marketed: Gucci Guilty Black was marketed towards very bold masculine young men. The variation of black in the name already suggests a heavier scent. The green glass is to add in an element of mystery and provocativeness. The ad was about lovers being fearless in their passion and with instinctive attraction, to drive each other to live lives to the fullest and always give in to pleasure and the excitement to break rules.

	<h2>Feelings</h2>
	<p>The fine fragrance that I am currently using is a cologne that makes a man feel strong and confident about himself.I have been using this scent for about three years now. It brings me strength and slightly borders sensual which excites me. I also believe that smell is an incredibly important part of work and personal life. 
Fragrance and smell have always been a way to attract the opposite gender. To me, the scent of the cologne reminds me that I'm gonna have an amazing day ahead it helps me calm my mind and body, Which allows me to be ready for anything, anywhere. I realise how important this cologne is to me.
For example, I started dating my partner because she complimented me on my cologne that first time we met. Which fills me with joy that the fine fragrance I am using is the right choice</p>
