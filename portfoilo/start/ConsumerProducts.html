		<h2>Bath and Body Works Aromatherapy lavender vanilla body lotion</h2>
		<p>Product Category : Body Care
Company : Bath and Body Works under L Brands (which also owns Victoria’s Secret) 
Fragrance descriptors: It is in the agrestic olfactory family, with the base notes being Lavandula Augustifolia and balsamic olfactory family with the top notes being vanilla
It is unique to me as it is marketed in the sleep range to help calm feelings of stress for better sleep and the directions for use indicates to inhale deeply when applying the lotion. 
From a study done by Britain’s University of Southhampton, it was found that Lavandula Augustifolia did improve mild insomnia when lavender was diffused into the room throughout the night. Furthermore, in a study from Wesleyan University, it was found that lavender increased slow-wave sleep, in which the heartbeat slows and muscles relax.

		<h2>Comparison</h2>
		<p>When I smell the Bath and Body works lotion, I instantly smell a sweet scent which can be attributed to the vanilla, however when I rub the lotion into my hand, the sweet smell dissipates and a calming lavender scent lingers. Compared to the Soap & Glory which smells extremely floral and feminine, and has only a singular scent. As someone who suffers from insomnia, the Bath and Body Works lotion definitely appeals to me more, it soothes and calms me down and isn’t too feminine. </p>

		<h2>Naruko Raw Jobs Tears Night Gelly</h2>
		<p>Product Category: Skin Care
Company: Naruko Taiwan
Fragrance descriptors:  Green olfactory family with Coix lacryma-jobi
This product is very interesting it features Job’s Tears (Coix Lacryma-Jobi) which is meant to be brightening. Job’s Tears is a grain-bearing tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is also commonly sold as Chinese pearl barley despite it not being closely related to barley. However, the scent of the Job’s Tears is exactly like barley.

		<h2>Origins A Perfect World Antioxidant moisturizer with White Tea</h2>
		<p>Product Category: Skin care
Brand: Origins
Company: Estee Lauder Companies
Fragrance Descriptors: Citrus family with bergamot, orange and lemon peel oil, fruity with blueberry, cranberry and wolfberry extract, floral with the white tea extract and passiflora extract. 

Comparison: Comparing the Origins and the Naruko, I prefer the Naruko as when I smell it, it smells of barley which invokes a more comforting scent as it is a familiar scent yet it is not commonly found in skincare. When I smell the Origins moisturizer, it smells floral and fruity, an extremely feminine smell. However, I lean towards the Naruko even though it is a more unconventional scent in skincare as it does not feel artificial, and it smells simple and gives me the idea that the skincare ingredients are basic and not complicated with more harmful stabilizers commonly found in skincare.
